## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend. The application allows users to track their daily activities and visualize progress over time.

## Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Interactive dashboard with data visualization
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Real-time updates using WebSockets
- Dark mode toggle

## Development Process

The development process involved several phases:

1. **Planning:** User stories, wireframing, and database schema design
2. **Frontend Development:** Building React components and implementing state management
3. **Backend Development:** Setting up API endpoints and database connections
4. **Integration:** Connecting frontend and backend systems
5. **Testing and Deployment:** Unit testing and deployment to cloud servers

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing the real-time updates feature. This was solved by using WebSocket connections to push updates to connected clients whenever data changes occurred in the database.
