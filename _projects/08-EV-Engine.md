## Overview

EV Engine is a DX12 renderer I started to improve my DX12 skills and rendering knowledge in general.  It is based off of the work of one of my lecturers: Jeremiah van Oosten. You can see his work on [3dgep](https://www.3dgep.com/)!

The goal of this engine is to have basic functionality to **render full scenes** for example Sponza with **PBR**, **IBL** and a **skybox**. From there the goal is to implement the following ideas:

- Volumetric clouds inspired by [Nubis](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/read/nubis-cubed)
- Ocean rendering
- Grass rendering 

The engine is still in early development. I started the engine in November 2025.

## What I did.

All work so far is done by simply following along with Jeremiah's tutorial. The result of which gave me a good base of understanding the concepts that are required to build a DX12 renderer from scratch, such as:

- Memory management / allocation system
- Resource barriers and transitions
- Mip Generation
- Root signatures
- Descriptors

## Up Next

This project is still a work in progress. Once it has more content the webpage will be updated!

The next step is to have a fully rendered scene.
