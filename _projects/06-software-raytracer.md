## Overview

This voxel raytracer is based on and inspired by the work of **Jacco Bikker**, one of our amazing lecturers at Breda University.

The raytracer is software based, and written entirely on the CPU.

### Key Contributions

  - Added Spotlights, Pointlights and Directional lights.
  - Added soft shadows for transparant and opaque objects. (stochastic rendering)
  - Added reflection and refraction.
  - Added texture projection to spotlights and directional lights.
  - Added Global Illumination.
  - Added voxel texture mapping.
  - Created a simple puzzle game.

## Glass..

This project was eye opening to me. Learning the possibilities of realism that raytracing can achieve and seeing the math formulas work together to render a stunning image.

The hardest part of the project was definitely the glass. It was hard for me to understand at first how the ray should refract, how many times it should refract, how I keep track and verify that the ray is correct..

After writing out the same mathimatical formula over and over, it turned out I was not accounting for the total internal reflection.

The result of debugging was worth it.

## Results & Reflections

This project, under guidance of **Jacco Bikker**, was definitely the most i've enjoyed any project at Buas. It required me to get pen and paper and write out math equations to understand what is happening and why. Each step of the way had me surprised with what I managed to achieve, which made me fall in love with Rendering.
