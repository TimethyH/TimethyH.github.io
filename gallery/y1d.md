For this project i spent 8 weeks researching Reinforcement Learning. My findings will be elaborated upon in the Blogs section, stay tuned!

In the Reinforcement Learning model i made, the Worm crawls towards you, the Spider and Scorpion keep their distance and shoot while manuvering around the player, the Beetle comes close and charges towards the player.

You can play this game on [itch.io](https://buas.itch.io/team-mace) !
